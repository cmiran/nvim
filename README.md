# .config/nvim

This Neovim configuration uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). It's tailored for Golang, SQL, TypeScript, and Solidity.

Many thanks to [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) from where I steal almost everything, the insights from [r/Neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/), guidance from [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and its accompanying [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ), and every custom config distributions which help and continually inspire. And a nod to [folke](https://github.com/folke) for being an indispensable beacon in the community.
