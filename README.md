# .config/nvim

This Neovim configuration uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). It's mostly tailored for Golang.

Many thanks to [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) from where I steal almost everything, the insights from [r/Neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/), and every custom configurations that continually help and inspire. And a nod to [folke](https://github.com/folke) for being an indispensable beacon in the community.
